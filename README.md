# Bubble Sort in C++

Presentation on Bubble Sort algorithm for C++ Programming Class

## Description
This repository contains examples demonstrating the bubble sort algorithm implementation in C++.

## About Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
